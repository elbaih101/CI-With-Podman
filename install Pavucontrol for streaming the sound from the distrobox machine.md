Install Pavucontrol

Pavucontrol is the gold-standard for managing the Pulse Audio sound server on Linux. Despite this, it’s not the default sound manager tool on mainstream Linux distributions. As a result, before we can continue with this tutorial, we’ll need to go over how to install the Pavucontrol audio manager.

To install Pavucontrol, launch a terminal window and follow the instructions that correspond with your Linux operating system.
Ubuntu

Ubuntu users can quickly install the Pavucontrol application using the Apt package manager.
```bash
sudo apt install pavucontrol
```
Alternatively, if you use Kbuntu or another Ubuntu Linux distribution that makes use of Qt, rather than GTK, install Pavucontrol-Qt.
```bash
sudo apt install pavucontrol-qt
```
Debian

Both Pavucontrol GTK and QT are available on all versions of Debian. To install either of these programs use the Apt-get package tool.
```bash
sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
```
or
```bash
sudo apt-get install pavucontrol-qt
```
Arch Linux

Need to get Pavucontrol or Pavucontrol Qt on your Arch Linux PC? Open up a terminal and use the Pacman packaging app to install it.
```bash
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
```
or
```bash
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol-qt
```
Fedora

Fedora Linux has both versions of the Pavucontrol audio management program in its software repositories. To get the app working, launch a terminal and use the DNF package manager.
```bash
sudo dnf install pavucontrol
```
or
```bash
sudo dnf install pavucontrol-qt
```
OpenSUSE

OpenSUSE has Pavucontrol and Pavucontrol Qt for all versions of the operating system, and it can be installed using the Zypper command.
```bash
sudo zypper install pavucontrol
```
or
```bash
sudo zypper install pavucontrol-qt
```
Then open the pauv control from the console
using command
* pavucontrol
